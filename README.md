# My TailwindCSS Playground

A small corner of the internet where I experiment with TailwindCSS.  
Sometimes for learning, sometimes for boredom, sometimes for therapy.  
A space to stretch ideas without needing them to *mean* anything. 🌿

### Why this exists
Building things can feel heavy when every project has to become:
a portfolio piece, a client deliverable, a startup, a "serious thing".

This is the opposite 🌱

### What’s inside 📦
Micro-experiments. Unfinished ideas. Small delights.  
Each one either:
- starts with curiosity 🧠
- or ends when it stops being interesting 🐚

No pressure to complete. No pressure to justify.

This repo is a reminder that coding can be soft, slow, and expressive.

Do whatever you want with anything in here.  
Fork it, remix it, rename it, ignore it ✨

Life is short. Make things that feel like you. 🌸
