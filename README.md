# My TailwindCSS Playground

A small corner of the internet where I experiment with TailwindCSS.  
Sometimes for learning, sometimes for boredom, sometimes for therapy.  
A space to stretch ideas without needing them to *mean* anything. 🌿

### Why this exists
Building things can feel heavy when every project has to become:
a portfolio piece, a client deliverable, a startup, a "serious thing".
